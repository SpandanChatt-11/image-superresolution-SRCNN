# image-superresolution-SRCNN
this project demonstrates how deep learning can be used to breathe  new life into low-quality images. While SRCNN is a foundational model, it opens the  door to more advanced super-resolution techniques, which hold immense potential  for real-world applications such as medical diagnosis, surveillance, and scientific  research.
